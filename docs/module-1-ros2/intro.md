# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI Robotics Book! In this module, we'll explore ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the foundational framework that serves as the "nervous system" for most robotic applications. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure, tools, and libraries that allow different components of a robot to work together seamlessly.

## Why ROS 2 Matters

ROS 2 is critical for robotics development because it:

- Provides a standardized communication framework between robot components
- Offers a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries
- Enables modular robot design with reusable components
- Supports real-time and distributed robotic systems
- Facilitates simulation and testing before real-world deployment

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions)
2. Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes in Python
3. Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
4. Design robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
5. Understand middleware options for real-time robot control

## Module Duration

This module is designed to take approximately 3-4 weeks to complete, depending on your prior experience with robotics and programming.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic Python programming skills
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts (variables, functions, classes)
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several key sections:

1. **ROS 2 Architecture** - Understanding Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
2. **Python-ROS Integration** - Using rclpy to create ROS 2 nodes in Python
3. **URDF for Humanoid Robots** - Describing robot structure and kinematics
4. **Middleware for Real-Time Control** - Understanding communication options for time-critical applications

## Real-World Applications

ROS 2 is used in numerous real-world applications, including:

- Autonomous vehicles and mobile robots
- Industrial automation and manufacturing
- Research robots in universities and labs
- Service robots for healthcare and hospitality
- Humanoid robots like Boston Dynamics' Atlas and other platforms

Let's begin by exploring the fundamental architecture of ROS 2!
