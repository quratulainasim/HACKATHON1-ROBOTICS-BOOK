# Clarification Questions: Physical AI Robotics Book

This document identifies areas in the feature specification that would benefit from additional clarification to ensure successful implementation.

## Question 1: Module Duration and Depth

**Context**: The specification mentions four modules but doesn't specify exact duration or depth for each.

**What we need to know**: How many chapters/sections should each module contain? What's the expected total page count or word count per module?

**Options**:
A) Each module should be approximately equal length (20-30 pages each)
B) Module length should vary based on complexity (Module 1: 15 pages, Module 2: 25 pages, etc.)
C) Focus on learning outcomes rather than page count

## Question 2: Technical Prerequisites

**Context**: The specification assumes readers have basic programming knowledge but doesn't specify the level required.

**What we need to know**: What specific prerequisites should readers have before starting? Should we include a prerequisites assessment?

**Options**:
A) Basic Python knowledge only
B) Previous robotics experience preferred
C) Include a foundational concepts appendix

## Question 3: Assessment Methodology

**Context**: Success criteria are defined but assessment methods aren't specified.

**What we need to know**: How should learning outcomes be assessed? Should we include quizzes, practical exercises, or projects?

**Options**:
A) Knowledge checks at the end of each chapter
B) Hands-on practical exercises with code/implementation
C) Comprehensive projects at the end of each module

## Question 4: Software Version Requirements

**Context**: The specification mentions ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac but doesn't specify versions.

**What we need to know**: Which specific versions of each tool should be used for compatibility?

**Options**:
A) Latest stable versions as of publication
B) Specific LTS versions for stability
C) Multiple version compatibility guidance

## Question 5: Hardware Requirements

**Context**: The specification doesn't address hardware requirements for implementation.

**What we need to know**: What hardware specifications are needed to run simulations and implementations effectively?

**Options**:
A) Minimum requirements for basic functionality
B) Recommended specifications for optimal performance
C) Cloud-based alternatives for resource-intensive tasks

These clarifications will help ensure the implementation meets all requirements and expectations.
